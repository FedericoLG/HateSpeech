### HateSpeech - I hate you

Hate speech detection on is critical for applications like controversial event extraction, building AI chatterbots, content recommendation, and sentiment analysis. We define this task as being able to classify a text comment as racist, sexist or neither. The complexity of the natural language constructs makes this task very challenging. 

The goal of the project is to compare the performance of the latest LLM models available over few hate speech datasets in Arabic and English, comparing performance between languages, analysis of performance trend over time, and variations in performance when changing pre-processing, data augmentation and dataset split procedure.

This exercise is carried out as part of the course *Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis - Master Degree in Data Science and Economics* taught by Prof. Emanuele Guidotti at the Milan State University.
