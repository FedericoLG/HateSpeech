        " - This network will have the `Bert` model.  Follwed by a `Droput` and `Linear Layer`. They are added for the purpose of **Regulariaztion** and **Classification** respectively. \n",
        " - In the forward loop, there are 2 output from the `BertModel` layer.\n",
        " - The second output `output_1` or called the `pooled output` is passed to the `Drop Out layer` and the subsequent output is given to the `Linear layer`. \n",
        " - Keep note the number of dimensions for `Linear Layer` is **6** because that is the total number of categories in which we are looking to classify our model.\n",
        " - The data will be fed to the `BertClass` as defined in the dataset. \n",
        " - Final layer outputs is what will be used to calcuate the loss and to determine the accuracy of models prediction. \n",
        " - We will initiate an instance of the network called `model`. This instance will be used for training and then to save the final trained model for future inference. \n",

        " - The Loss is defined in the next cell as `loss_fn`.\n",
